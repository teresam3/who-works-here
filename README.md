# Unit 12 MySQL Homework: Employee Tracker
## PROCESS 

In order to complete the employee tracker, what is first involved is to add all the npm packages needed. For this project, we need mysql, inquirer, and console.table. Therefore, onto the server file we create all the require variables. Then created a connection between mysql and our server. After the connection the initital prompt asked what tasked did the user want to accomplish today. Depending on the response, it then led to another function which will lead to the task needed. 

## Instructions

Build a command-line application that at a minimum allows the user to:

  * Add departments, roles, employees

  * View departments, roles, employees

  * Update employee roles

Bonus points if you're able to:

  * Update employee managers

  * View employees by manager

  * Delete departments, roles, and employees

  * View the total utilized budget of a department -- ie the combined salaries of all employees in that department


## User story

```

* You may wish to have a separate file containing functions for performing specific SQL queries you'll need to use. Could a constructor function or a class be helpful for organizing these?

* You will need to perform a variety of SQL JOINS to complete this assignment, and it's recommended you review the week's activities if you need a refresher on this.

### Hints

* You may wish to include a `seed.sql` file to pre-populate your database. This will make development of individual features much easier.

* Focus on getting the basic functionality completed before working on more advanced features.

* Review the week's activities for a refresher on MySQL.

* Check out [SQL Bolt](https://sqlbolt.com/) for some extra MySQL help.

## Minimum Requirements

* Functional application.

* GitHub repository with a unique name and a README describing the project.

* The command-line application should allow users to:

  * Add departments, roles, employees

  * View departments, roles, employees

  * Update employee roles

## Bonus

* The command-line application should allow users to:
