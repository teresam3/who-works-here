# Unit 12 MySQL Homework: Employee Tracker

## User story
As a business owner
I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
So that I can organize and plan my business

## PROCESS 

In order to complete the employee tracker, what is first involved is to add all the npm packages needed. For this project, we need mysql, inquirer, and console.table. Therefore, onto the server file we create all the require variables. Then created a connection between mysql and our server. After the connection the initital prompt asked what tasked did the user want to accomplish today. Depending on the response, it then led to another function which will lead to the task needed. 

##


## Instructions

Built a command-line application that allows the user to:

  * Add departments, roles, employees

  * View departments, roles, employees

  * Update employee roles

* You may wish to include a `seed.sql` file to pre-populate your database. This will make development of individual features much easier.
