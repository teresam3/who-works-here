# Unit 12 MySQL Homework: Employee Tracker

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. In this homework assignment, your challenge is to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

## PROCESS 

In order to complete the employee tracker, what is first involved is to add all the npm packages needed. For this project, we need mysql, inquirer, and console.table. Therefore, onto the server file we create all the require variables.

## Instructions

Build a command-line application that at a minimum allows the user to:

  * Add departments, roles, employees

  * View departments, roles, employees

  * Update employee roles

Bonus points if you're able to:

  * Update employee managers

  * View employees by manager

  * Delete departments, roles, and employees

  * View the total utilized budget of a department -- ie the combined salaries of all employees in that department


## User story

I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
So that I can organize and plan my business
```

* You may wish to have a separate file containing functions for performing specific SQL queries you'll need to use. Could a constructor function or a class be helpful for organizing these?

* You will need to perform a variety of SQL JOINS to complete this assignment, and it's recommended you review the week's activities if you need a refresher on this.

### Hints

* You may wish to include a `seed.sql` file to pre-populate your database. This will make development of individual features much easier.

* Focus on getting the basic functionality completed before working on more advanced features.

* Review the week's activities for a refresher on MySQL.

* Check out [SQL Bolt](https://sqlbolt.com/) for some extra MySQL help.

## Minimum Requirements

* Functional application.

* GitHub repository with a unique name and a README describing the project.

  * Add departments, roles, employees

  * View departments, roles, employees

  * Update employee roles

  * View employees by manager

  * Delete departments, roles, and employees

  * View the total utilized budget of a department -- ie the combined salaries of all employees in that department

## Submission on BCS
